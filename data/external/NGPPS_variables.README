Dear Chris,

The values of the Monte Carlo variables unfortunately cannot be retrieved from the DACE website. I am sending you the values in a file here. The format is quite simple, with the first item on each
line being the system number (which can be matched to the system_id in DACE after removing the leading "SIM" letters), then are given the variables in a NAME=VALUE format. These are:
- MSTAR: the stellar mass in units of solar masses. Always 1 in this case.
- SIGMA: the gas surface density at the reference location (r0=5.2 AU) in g/cm^2. This is "\Sigma_{g,0}" in the NGPPS I paper.
- EXPO: the power-law index of the initial gas profile, always set to 0.9 ("\beta_g" in NGPPS I).
- AIN: the location of the inner edge of the gas disc in AU ("r_{in}" in NGPPS I).
- AOUT: the characteristic radius of the gas disc in AU ("r_{cut}" in NGPPS I). This is not an independent variable, as we describe in NGPPS II (see Eq. (1)).
- FPG: the dust-to-gas ratio ("f_{D/G}" in NGPPS II)
- MWIND: the integrated external photoevaporation rate in solar masses per year ("\dot{M}_{wind}" in NGPPS II).

The initial gas disc mass can be retrieved from these parameters using Eq. (14) from the NGPPS I paper or Eq. (1) of NGPPS II.

Concerning the dust-to-gas ratio, we used a distribution that is relevant from nearby stars (for the benefit of comparison with radial velocity surveys). The range of values we used already permits to
draw certain conclusions (see Figs. 26 and 27 of NGPPS II), such as that there are no giant planets below [Fe/H] ~ -0.2. This is because for low-metallicity environments, there are no enough solids to
form a massive core before the dispersal of the gas disc. For lower-mass planets, I believe the trends observed in those figures can be extrapolated, namely that there will be less planets of any
mass. Again, this is a mass budget problem, because the solid contents of these discs is relatively small. 

I hope this answers your e-mail. Please let me know if you still have questions.

Best regards,
Alexandre Emsenhuber
